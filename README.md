# CISC482/682 project: Team LunchBox
Hi there! This is our team's submission for TA07 (previously TA06). It has our Android Studio project files for a food trading app for one university campus.

## Team members

## Project Organization
When creating this project, we started with a blank app with an activity view. Then we each made a branch to commit to and worked separately on our tasks. You can see the branches in the screenshot below. Each person has made at least one commit to their corresponding branch. Everyone has committed at least once for TA07. (There are even more branches now too since we tried different features)
